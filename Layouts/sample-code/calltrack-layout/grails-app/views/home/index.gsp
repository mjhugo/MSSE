		<h1>Welcome to Grails using Kickstart with Bootstrap</h1>
		<p>Congratulations, you have successfully started your first
			Grails application with the Kickstart extension! At the moment this
			is the default page, feel free to modify it to either redirect to a
			controller or display whatever content you may choose. Below is a
			list of controllers that are currently deployed in this application,
			click on each to execute its default action:</p>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Kickstart is an extension for Grails in order to start your
			project with a good looking frontend. It is intended to be used in
			rapid application scenarios such as a Startup Weekend or a
			prototyping session with a customer. This plugin provides adapted
			scaffolding templates for standard CRUD pages using the Bootstrap web
			page template by Twitter. Additionally, Kickstart includes some
			general GSPs pages (e.g., about.gsp), a minimal logging/orientation
			Filter, and a language switcher.</p>
		<p>Currently, Kickstart is intended to act more like an injection
			than an plugin - importent files are copied into your project and you
			can remove the plugin afterwards.</p>

				<h2>Usage</h2>
				<p>After installation you can call the script "grails
					kickstartWithBootstrap" which will copy several files into your
					project. It will overwrite only few files (e.g., in conf, src, and
					views) - '''you should use it only on fresh new Grails projects'''.
				</p>
				<p>Afterwards create your domain classes (or copy them into the
					project) and generate contollers and views - they will now use the
					Bootstrap framework!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="span4">
				<h2>Notes</h2>
				<p></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Currently, only tested with Grails 1.3.7!</li>
					<li>Does only use plain Bootstrap (currently, without Less).</li>
					<li>The plugin copies the files into your project - you can
						uninstall the plugin thereafter.</li>
					<li>It does NOT use the Bootstrap plugin.</li>
				</ul>
